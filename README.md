Here you can find a **Javascript** implementation of the **Java** program written by **Robert Sedgewick** on the subject of **Event Driven Simulation**.

One of my favourite subjects in computer science is algorithms and data structures. To people who might be reading this and are also interested in
this subject, I strongly recommend reading the books of Robert Sedgewick on this subject. The books are also backed by a very good website:
http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/ and several coursera.org courses like: **Algorithms, Part I** and **II** and **Analysis of Algorithms** (look here https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~211)

One of the areas where these courses can be applied is to create a **Brownian motion simulator** with literally millions of particles!!!
You can find such a system implemented in the Java programming language on: http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/61event/. The author calls it an Event Driven Simulator.

You can check out this code if you want to see how such a system might be implemented in javascript rather than java...

Coding is just half of the thing and I strongly suggest to really understand the ideas of an event driven system first, in particular:

* What are priority queues(you can find this here: http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/24pq/  and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9TMe0KC0w0&list=PLxc4gS-_A5VDXUIOPkJkwQKYiT2T1t0I8&index=34)

* How does an event driven simulation system differ from a time driven simulation system.

To ease a little bit the learning experience, here is a video on this topic by Robert Sedgevick: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irbshkdVFao&index=37&list=PLxc4gS-_A5VDXUIOPkJkwQKYiT2T1t0I8

Good luck and enjoy learning ! :)
